            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
            I just started learning how to code with python last semester and I am learning how to use C this semester. With that said I have never learned how websites worked and wanted to learn more about it. I have always liked coding and was watching a lot of Youtubers that used coding. I thought it was really interesting and wanted to learn more about it. Thats why I chose Comp. Sci. as my major. I also like snowboarding and videogames.
